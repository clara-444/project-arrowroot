    Project Arrowroot will leverage the climate anxiety experienced by 78% of youth in Canada and empower students to take action, mitigate climate anxiety, and foster climate hope through tangible actions that lead to professional development and a career in a green industry. 
Context: As the climate crisis continues and youth continue to witness the devastating impacts of climate change while feeling powerless, there is a unique opportunity to amplify intergenerational collaboration, strengthen capacity-building measures, and mobilize the next generation entering the workforce for effective climate action. Many private and public sectors seeking to decarbonize are eager to increase commitment to Science Based Targets and achieve a net-zero emissions future, while sustainable reporting standards grow stricter under government regulation. 
Simultaneously, as high school students nearing graduation plan for their next steps, with a significant number intending on pursuing post-secondary education at universities and colleges, the programs they select are often decisions rooted in parental pressure, industry misconceptions, and pure career uncertainty. Besides the pressures of planning what seems to be the rest of their lives (with their post-secondary education assumedly determining the trajectory of their lifelong career), the young people of today also experience notable climate anxiety. With 6551 wildfires in Canada during the year of 2023 and many more environmental disasters, it is blatantly obvious that there is a need to rapidly decarbonize our communities and industries. yet the school curriculum has not adapted to accommodate these contemporary challenges and equip students with the tools and insights needed to embed the climate in their career.
