                            <p>The Government of Canada has reported that there will be ~400,000 new jobs in Canada from building a net-zero emissions economy by the end of this decade, but what do these jobs actually look like? What does it actually mean to have a "green job"? This dynamic and interactive Q&A session demystifies the rapidly growing green economy and helps students find their place in it. Led by a youth professional in the climate space, this workshop moves beyond traditional environmental roles to explore the vast landscape of careers in sectors like renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, green technology, policy, and corporate sustainability.</p>
                            <p>The intro to green jobs and how 8 out of 10 major economic sectors will be affected by climate adaptation will be followed by an open-floor Q&A session, driven by pre-provided questions from the teacher as well as student questions during the session, providing a personalized and relevant exploration of the skills, educational pathways, and opportunities available for a meaningful career with impact.</p>

                            <p>As Global North citizens, how does responsibility and impact show up in our lifestyles? How do our consumption trends connect to the climate crisis? This workshop demystifies the world of corporate sustainability by taking a critical look at ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) principles. Students will investigate cases of greenwashing, understand planned obsolescence, and learn the key role that financial institutions play in funding the fossil fuel industry, while empowering them to see themselves as agents of change.</p>
                            <p>It also points out problems with ideas like “carbon neutral,” showing why real emissions cuts (“real zero”) are more important than buying offsets. The presentation highlights how everyday choices around food, travel, shopping, tech, and banking all connect to ESG issues. Finally, it encourages us to think about the whole life cycle of the things we use, notice when companies design products to break quickly (planned obsolescence), and reflect on what role we can play as consumers in creating fairer and more sustainable systems.</p>

                            <p>This workshop explores how gender and climate change intersect, with a focus on empowering young women as sustainability leaders. The session first highlights the challenges women face in the context of climate change, such as greater health risks, exclusion from decision-making, lack of funding, and gender-specific threats. The “eco-gender gap” is also introduced to show how women often express stronger concern for the environment yet are underrepresented in leadership and consumer influence. Overall, this workshop makes tangible connections between global issues and local policy, preparing students to think critically about community development.</p>
                            <p>A case study (TransformWR) demonstrates gaps in integrating gender equity into sustainability planning, followed by insights on women’s leadership in business sustainability. The workshop concludes with reflection questions on defining empowerment, recognizing role models, and considering advocacy pathways.</p>
