I enjoy my chemistry and biology classes and learning in general. I’m part of a small gardening club at my school’s greenhouse. We plant a multitude of different varieties of plants as well as building our very own hydroponic system. I love swimming and snowboarding with friends. I also enjoy playing the piano with my band and participating in my school concerts. Next year, I hope to study environmental sciences and pursue my fondness for all things nature and plant based.</p>

In my free time, I love creating visual art and exploring cultural perspectives through films and paintings. In academia, I am passionate about math, physics and chemistry. In the coming year of 2026, I hope to pursue an undergraduate degree in either chemical engineering, chemical physics, or a related field. While I appreciate these subjects in their theoretical forms, I’m excited to apply them to real-world scenarios, particularly in ecological contexts, through opportunities in post-secondary and organisations like Project Arrowroot!</p>

                                <p>Hi, I'm Taylor! I'm in my final year as an undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia, majoring in Global Resource Systems and specialising in Environmental Management and Sustainable Development. My career interests span far, but through my studies, I've become particularly interested in carbon and energy management, renewable energy, carbon accounting, environmental engineering, sustainability consulting, environmental policy, impact evaluation, and environmental communications. Outside of school, I am a co-founder of Climate Education for All (an organisation working to expand climate literacy to all undergraduate students), and I also teach and practice a TON of yoga! I've been lucky to live in the US, Australia, France, and Canada as a student, and this summer, I was able to go to Indonesia to evaluate a youth education program at a Masjid. I'm from California and am passionate about politics (I love Newsom!), which has prompted a new passion of mine for working in policy/government. Beyond this, however, I have a lot of loves and hope to explore them further within the years following my graduation.</p>

My background in front-line community work and high-volume customer service has strengthened my ability to listen actively, communicate with clarity and empathy, and consolidate trust with people from all walks of life. One of my most prevailing passions spans from childhood: it's the ocean. Conservancy and advocacy for the habitats and creatures that cannot speak for themselves is always front of mind for me. I enjoy attending shoreline cleanups and making a difference in this way, yet there's a lot more to be done. I carry a solutions-focused mindset, can remain calm under pressure, and have a commitment to making systems more accessible for everyone. It's my goal to leave this world at least a little bit better than how I found it. I see a path ahead to do this with Project Arrowroot, as well as a golden opportunity to grow professionally and personally. I’m especially motivated to apply my skills within climate education; where clear communication, community engagement, and access are essential. I'd like to make life better. And I know this cannot be done alone, yet I believe my capabilities in outreach, engagement, and support will help catalyze meaningful climate action.</p>

I love being in the backcountry for both hiking and kayaking and am enrolled at UBC to study conservation science next year. I’m currently working hard on expanding my school’s existing garden into a native pollinator garden and look forward to seeing the result, having obtained $2500 in grant funding so far! In my spare time, I enjoy swimming and indoor rock climbing when the weather’s too miserable for my tastes.</p>

            <p>Project Arrowroot acknowledges that Indigenous peoples are the traditional guardians of this land that we
                call Canada, where we live, work, and learn. This program was created on the unceded and ancestral
                territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) people. For more information on Indigenous lands, visit <a
